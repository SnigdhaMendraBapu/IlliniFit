## Preparing for your release
Each submission should be in its own [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases). Release are specific freezes to your repository. You should submit your commit hash on PrairieLearn. When tagging your stage, please use the tag `stage.x` where x is the number to represent the stage.
